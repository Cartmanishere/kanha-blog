title: Why start this blog again?

# Motivation

I’ve been planning to start a blog — not for writing traditional blog posts, but for sharing documentation.

Whenever I dive into a rabbit hole, I often come back with a lot of knowledge that feels unnecessary or immediately useless. So, I wanted a place where I could just dump everything and forget about it.

I already do this in my Org note files, so I thought: why not make these notes public? It may or may not interest anyone, but at least I’d feel good about sharing something. In a way, this act of sharing would make the time I spent chasing random topics feel less wasted.

With that in mind, I’m going to start by publishing a lot of the thoughts and explorations I’ve documented—or that only exist in my head. This won’t be the most effective or organized approach, but I believe in the power of getting started.

As Rich Hickey once said in a talk:

> Inefficiency is essential to learning.

So, let this be inefficient, and hopefully, with time, it will become more refined.
